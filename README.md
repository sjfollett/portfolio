# Projects Portfolio

## Project 1 - Monte Carlo Risk Model (link to code)
- Utilizes pandas datareader to gather stock data 
- Looking at daily close price, calulates average daily move & standard deviation of average daily move
- Applies a random walk starting at current price and then applying a random variable to average daily move and standard deviation
- Scalable timeframes and number of simulations 
- Aggregates results from multiple random walks and visualizes the result

## Project 2 - Linear Regression (link to code)
- Examined relationship between Oil price and USD/RUB FX conversion price
- Trained model on 2014-2016 data 
- Regressed on 2016-2018 data utilizing Sk_learn Package & calculated R2 
- Visualized result

## Project 3 - Logistic Regression (Classification Alogrithm) 
- Looked at portfolio of 150k loan applications to determine which items on the loan application are most sensitive to determinig default
- Found the best correlated indicators and assigned weights to them 
- Ran logisitc regression with 70/30 test train split 
- Analyzed results
